What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the .git files are added. these contain some kind of metadata that git needs in order to functions. 

the first commit is not yet crearted.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it prepares the commit. adds more flexibility for what to commit at the same time. you can better break down changes to files.
